			<p>In 1952, Sergej Pavlin, who was then a young architecture student, created the first bottle and label for Yugo Cockta, which was advertised as Cockta Cockta. He also produced a number of advertising products: packaging for the bottles, the design to be painted on delivery trucks, costumes with advertising for ski-jumpers in Planica, and so on. His proposal in 1952 for a poster depicting a Polar bear drinking Cockta was not accepted, but 40 years later, Coca Cola made a Polar bear its icon. The poster that did become famous and which is still recognised today was designed by Uro≈° Vagaja and show a suntanned girl with a pony tail, wearing a yellow t-shirt and drinking Cockta.</p>
