			<p>Davorin Savnik (1929–2014) was an industrial designer and architect from Slovenia.
			His work includes designing audiovisual and telecommunication devices, telephones, electro technical and electro-medical equipment, hand tools, household appliance and computer equipment. 
			The most recognizable devices from his collection of design works were the telephones. His most renowned work was the ETA 80 telephone from 1978, which soon became a part of numerous households and offices around Slovenia and worldwide. Telephones were produced by the Iskra company in Kranj. The telephone has become highly recognized abroad as well, and received many distinctions for its aesthetic form, including a Good Design Award. It has been adopted as part of the permanent exhibition of outstandingly designed modern products at the Museum of Modern Art in Munich, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, and Ljubljana Architecture Museum in Ljubljana.
			Savnik’s idea has been copied by numerous manufacturers around the world, in a total output of 300 million pieces. Articles and pictures portraying the telephone have been published by Japanese, American, British, Russian, Czech and Croatian professional journals and newspapers. He died in 2014 aged 85.</p>
